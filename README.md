London, 1950.

In a dark city, shrouded in steam and mystery, machines reign supreme as absolute masters. Between rusted iron skyscrapers, giant gears that turn ceaselessly, and airships silently floating above the streets, the English capital has become a hub of cutting-edge technology. But beneath its cobbled streets and copper facades, secrets lurk: intelligent machines, spy submarines, programs encoded in the very steam itself, and enigmas that only the sharpest minds can decipher.

In this 1950s steampunk London, the city provides a unique backdrop with its foggy streets, imposing machines, and dimly lit electric lamps. You will navigate through the damp alleyways of Whitechapel, the aerial bridges connecting massive buildings, and the dark industrial quarters where the shadows of machines loom like menacing specters.
