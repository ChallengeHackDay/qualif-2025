Welcome to MI5!

Sorry, but you won’t have time to settle in because your first mission has already arrived.
To provide some context, Eve is an agent who joined our agency five years ago and had been working on the search for the Hoxne treasure. We have finally found a map that seems to lead to the treasure. However, the traitor Eve has fled with the map.
Your mission is simple: find Eve.

Agent, Eve left subtle traces in her choice of words and references. A strange post-it found on her desk, stuck to a book titled Neuromancer by William Gibson, bore the inscription:
"Within the maze of the matrix, intelligence always plays a double game. Look where it all begins, and you’ll uncover the one pulling the strings."

We believe she was referring to a classic piece of cyberpunk literature, where manipulation and betrayal are central themes. If you are astute enough to decipher this riddle, you will uncover the key hidden within this futuristic digital universe.

- First, decrypt with a key and a salt, you'll cry while searching for the only word.
- Then, decode the first layer of encoding, which uses a format specific to IPv6 (compact representation).
