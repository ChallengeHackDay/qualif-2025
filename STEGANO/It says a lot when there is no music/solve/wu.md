A Python script makes it easy to extract the numerical values used by a .wav file to encode the music.

The challenge’s title, "It says a lot when there is no music”, hints that the solution may lie in the absence of sound. Since there are no extended periods of silence in the middle of the music, it makes sense to investigate the beginning and the end of the file first.

While the beginning of the file doesn’t reveal anything unusual, the end contains a long sequence of zeros
followed by a few numbers. When these numbers are plotted on a graph, they don’t resemble typical
audio data. Instead, they seem to encode something else.

The next step is to copy these numbers and use dCode to decode them. By interpreting the numbers as
ASCII values, they reveal the flag.

A version of the python code which solves the challenge :
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.io import wavfile
# Read the .wav file
filename = "suspicious_audio.wav"
sample_rate, data = wavfile.read(filename)
# Check if the file is stereo or mono (useless here)
if len(data.shape) > 1: # Stereo
data = data[:, 0]
# Create a time array
print(len(data))
data = data[13641006:]
duration = len(data) / sample_rate
time = [i / sample_rate for i in range(len(data))]
print(data)
# Plot the waveform
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(time, data, label="Audio Signal")
plt.title("Waveform of " + filename)
plt.xlabel("Time (seconds)")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
# Save the plot to a file
output_file = "waveform_plot.png"
plt.savefig(output_file)
print(f"Plot saved as {output_file}")
```
