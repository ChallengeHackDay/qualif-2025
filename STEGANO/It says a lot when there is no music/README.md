Yesterday, the police arrested a criminal for the murder of an inventor, a man who claimed to have designed a ""jetpack"" that would allow flight without a dirigible. During the interrogation, the criminal stated that he had been ordered to commit the act, before handing over a USB key containing a single file. This audio file seems deceptively simple, but who knows, it may hide a much more complex message. 

Your mission : Uncover what lies behind this seemingly innocent sound !
