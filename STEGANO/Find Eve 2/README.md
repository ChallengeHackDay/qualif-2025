Agent,

We’ve recovered a folder of images from Eve's old workstation. Our analysts believe she’s hidden something critical within them.

Eve was meticulous, and she often left traces of her tools behind. Study the files closely—sometimes, the smallest details hold the biggest secrets.

Your mission is to uncover what she’s buried and figure out how to unlock it.

Good luck.
