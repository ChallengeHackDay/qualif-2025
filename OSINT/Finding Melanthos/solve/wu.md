Starting with account X, we find out if Melanthos has an account on other social networks. 

We find one on Instagram, where he has posted a photo similar to the one on X and where he specifies that he's going out for sport with his friends. 

Looking through his subscriptions, we find an account that is interesting, that of melanthos_friend. On this account, an image is posted, and on it we see the name of a building. 

A Google search turns up the address. 

And a search of the surrounding area reveals a number of sports complexes, including a climbing gym (Arkose Massy) with a facade that looks exactly like the one in the photo, so we've found where Melanthos is located!

Alternatively, for the end (after having found the Intagram account and the gym), we could use the reflection of the building opposite to find the exact location by wandering around on google maps in the vicinity of the gym.
