How to do it:  
Extract a portion of the SSH key to search for relevant information. Look up the SSH key on Pastebin, where you’ll find Edgar’s account. On one of Edgar’s posts, you’ll notice a string encoded multiple times in base64. This string, when decoded, reveals the URL to the Google Drive folder (without the domain name).
